Berlin based software engineer with 5 years [experience](/cv) using AWS, K8S, SQL, Dagster, Terraform, Linux and more.  
I am passionate about helping people from marginalised backgrounds get their start in tech.  
I'm an avid (but bad) chess player, bread maker, lager drinker and pickled-food expert.

You can read my [blog](/blog) where I write about whatever I'm interested in.  

Feel free to [get in touch](/contact), I'm always happy to chat.

My [cv](/cv) is available here, although I am not actively looking for a new role.
